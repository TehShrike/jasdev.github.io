&lt;h3&gt;My take on building a better self&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sports involving competing against oneself have always been my fuel. Whether it was running cross country in high school or making the decision to start weight training upon entering university, I love being able to do something today that I wasn’t capable of the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two years ago, I wanted to formally take this approach with my personal habits. Initially, I used a combination of daily visits to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated&quot;&gt;r/GetMotivated&lt;/a&gt; and the web app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chains.cc&quot;&gt;chains.cc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/chainscc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GetMotivated subreddit is a fantastic collection of inspirational posts and is a factor that has remained constant throughout my journey of building a better self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing — that’s why we recommend it daily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, chains.cc actually served as more of a crutch than a boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chains.cc allows you to enter various habits and each day that you complete them, you add a day to your chain. The problem lies in its emphasis on forming long chains. Sure, not breaking a long chain is motivation to keep up a habit, but it also serves as a huge downer when you break it. So, instead of focusing on the fact that I was able to get into the gym for 20 days last month, I’m left with a stark reminder that I broke a daily streak I was on. Clearly, this perspective on habits wasn’t going to work in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I found Lift (now rebranded as &lt;a href=&quot;https://coach.me&quot;&gt;Coach.me&lt;/a&gt;). An iOS and web app that takes a more solid approach to habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/lift.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lift will always be on my home row&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like chains.cc, Lift allows you to add specific habits and track them from day to day. However, in creating a better self, you are not alone. Lift buckets you with other people striving towards the same goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/lift-habits.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after checking off a habit, I often get random ‘props’ from people. While this may seem silly, the feedback loop is amazing. It’s like people giving you high fives along the marathon we call life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fitocracy.com&quot;&gt;Fitocracy&lt;/a&gt; is another great example of this prop behavior being used well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two other key features that set Lift apart are reminders and a focus on milestones. Reminders make perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminders can be set to day/time granularity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I get pushed a reminder to use a standing desk, midday, a reminder to talk to a stranger, and at night, I wrap up with writing three positives things about today. Unlike chains.cc, milestones help alleviate the stress of breaking chains. Instead, you’re rewarded when you hit specific phases in a habit (e.g. tenth checkin or mini streaks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the habits I’ve started forming with Lift, I’d like to point out one in particular. Writing three positive things about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lift.do/post/54035976743/habit-of-the-day-write-three-positive-things-about&quot;&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt; on this habit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 days into it, this habit has allowed me to have a stream of consciousness like never before. Whether I just feel great after a workout or make an awesome first impression, I constantly look for the gems in life. Imagine looking at this log just a year from now, 1095 things that made your days amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a few of the tools I use to build a better self. I’m still learning, tweaking, and testing my approach. But, that’s the beauty of it. Becoming better than you were yesterday is not merely a habit, it’s a way to live life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, this may be my first post towards a habit of writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
