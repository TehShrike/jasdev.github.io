<h3>My take on building a better self</h3>

<p>Sports involving competing against oneself have always been my fuel. Whether it was running cross country in high school or making the decision to start weight training upon entering university, I love being able to do something today that I wasn’t capable of the day before.</p>

<p>About two years ago, I wanted to formally take this approach with my personal habits. Initially, I used a combination of daily visits to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated">r/GetMotivated</a> and the web app, <a href="https://chains.cc">chains.cc</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/chainscc.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The GetMotivated subreddit is a fantastic collection of inspirational posts and is a factor that has remained constant throughout my journey of building a better self.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing — that’s why we recommend it daily.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, chains.cc actually served as more of a crutch than a boost.</p>

<p>chains.cc allows you to enter various habits and each day that you complete them, you add a day to your chain. The problem lies in its emphasis on forming long chains. Sure, not breaking a long chain is motivation to keep up a habit, but it also serves as a huge downer when you break it. So, instead of focusing on the fact that I was able to get into the gym for 20 days last month, I’m left with a stark reminder that I broke a daily streak I was on. Clearly, this perspective on habits wasn’t going to work in the long term.</p>

<p>That’s when I found Lift (now rebranded as <a href="https://coach.me">Coach.me</a>). An iOS and web app that takes a more solid approach to habits.</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/lift.png" alt=""></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lift will always be on my home row</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like chains.cc, Lift allows you to add specific habits and track them from day to day. However, in creating a better self, you are not alone. Lift buckets you with other people striving towards the same goals.</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/lift-habits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, after checking off a habit, I often get random ‘props’ from people. While this may seem silly, the feedback loop is amazing. It’s like people giving you high fives along the marathon we call life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.fitocracy.com">Fitocracy</a> is another great example of this prop behavior being used well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two other key features that set Lift apart are reminders and a focus on milestones. Reminders make perfect sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reminders can be set to day/time granularity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the morning, I get pushed a reminder to use a standing desk, midday, a reminder to talk to a stranger, and at night, I wrap up with writing three positives things about today. Unlike chains.cc, milestones help alleviate the stress of breaking chains. Instead, you’re rewarded when you hit specific phases in a habit (e.g. tenth checkin or mini streaks).</p>

<p>Out of the habits I’ve started forming with Lift, I’d like to point out one in particular. Writing three positive things about today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/54035976743/habit-of-the-day-write-three-positive-things-about">stats</a> on this habit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>40 days into it, this habit has allowed me to have a stream of consciousness like never before. Whether I just feel great after a workout or make an awesome first impression, I constantly look for the gems in life. Imagine looking at this log just a year from now, 1095 things that made your days amazing.</p>

<hr>

<p>These are a few of the tools I use to build a better self. I’m still learning, tweaking, and testing my approach. But, that’s the beauty of it. Becoming better than you were yesterday is not merely a habit, it’s a way to live life.</p>

<p>Who knows, this may be my first post towards a habit of writing?</p>
