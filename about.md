Hi, my name is Jasdev Singh! I'm an engineer who loves building APIs and iOS apps! I currently work at [Peloton](https://www.pelotoncycle.com) as a software engineer.

I've previously worked at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) as an iOS Core Engineer, [Imgur](http://imgur.com) as an API and iOS engineer, and spent time building side projects at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). Before that, I interned at Twitter (in the [KPCB Fellow '13 Class](http://kpcbfellows.com)), [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com), and Microsoft. I was one of the founders of UVa's [first student hackathon](http://hackuva.io) and also studied math and computer science there (SEAS '14).

In my free time, I love building [habits](https://www.coach.me/users/3140daf3d432d7f0065b), cycling, reading, and following [corgi accounts](https://www.instagram.com/zoeydacorgi/) on Instagram. Also, I run [Public Extension](https://twitter.com/publicextension), where I tweet out handy Swift language extensions. Occasionally, I give [talks](https://github.com/Jasdev/talks)! [Dance music](https://soundcloud.com/jasdev-singh) is a big part of my life (wrote my [thesis on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irAFO2rGvTg)).

I'm originally from and grew up in [Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia), lived in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) after graduating, and am currently living in New York!
