Hi, my name is Jasdev Singh! I'm currently an engineer at Imgur working on their iOS
app and API.

I've previously attended [CodePath](http://codepath.com) (Spring 2015, Swift). Interned at Twitter (in the [KPCB Fellow '13 Class](http://kpcbfellows.com)), [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com), and Microsoft. I was one of the founders of UVa's [first student hackathon](http://hackuva.io) and also studied math and computer science there (SEAS '14'). In my free time, I love building [habits](https://www.coach.me/users/3140daf3d432d7f0065b), attending hackathons, using emojis (my favorite is ðŸš€), [bhangra](https://youtu.be/vXgF-Ezg78c?t=15s), [reading](/reading-list/), and browsing [r/corgi](http://imgur.com/r/corgi/top).

I'm originally from and grew up in [Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia), lived in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) for a year after graduating, and am currently working remotely!
