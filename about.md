Hi, my name is Jasdev Singh! I'm an engineer who loves building APIs and iOS apps! I currently work at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) as an iOS Core Engineer.

I've previously worked at [Imgur](http://imgur.com) as an API and iOS engineer. Before that, I interned at Twitter (in the [KPCB Fellow '13 Class](http://kpcbfellows.com)), [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com), and Microsoft. I was one of the founders of UVa's [first student hackathon](http://hackuva.io) and also studied math and computer science there (SEAS '14). In my free time, I love building [habits](https://www.coach.me/users/3140daf3d432d7f0065b), using emojis (my favorite is ðŸš€), [bhangra](https://youtu.be/vXgF-Ezg78c?t=15s), reading, and browsing [r/corgi](http://imgur.com/r/corgi/top). Also, I run a fun account called [Public Extension](https://twitter.com/publicextension), where I tweet out handy Swift language extensions each weekday! Occasionally, I give [talks](https://github.com/Jasdev/talks)! [Space will always fascinate me](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/428517906813423616).

I'm originally from and grew up in [Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Station,_Virginia), lived in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) for a year after graduating, and am currently living in [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn)!

I also help mentor students at [hack.cville](http://hackcville.com) and junior iOS developers at [CodePath](http://www.codepath.com).

You can find my resume [here](/public/resume.pdf).
