title: Chasing Earned Fatigue

I usually cringe at the trite question: “what does success mean to you?” But, [Jodie Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Foster)’s answer has stuck with me over the years. “In the end, winning is _sleeping better_.”

When I first heard this, I paused the podcast I was listening to and immediately made a note. Foster [powerfully compresses](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/5/11/jpeg-your-ideas) so much into a handful of words. For me, sleeping **better** requires two things. [Allocating enough time for sleep](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/181dbeacaf083497ad10f080247a2e5b9b4af401/daily-list.md#L8) and the sensation of _earning_ my fatigue<sup>1</sup>. The latter usually arises from a day filled with total dedication to each task. One where I come back to my apartment, drop my things, and crash-land onto my bed<sup>2</sup> with accomplishment pumping through me.
