When building a new habit, momentum is often the hardest part for me. Starting small helps, but I often need a larger impetus. To tackle this, I began tracking relevant factors to each habit. For example, last year, I made a goal of spending less time on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook). I did not take this habit seriously until I installed [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com) and realized how much time I was wasting. RescueTime is a small app that runs on your computer (and Android phone), tracking how much time you spend on specific applications and websites. In my first full month of tracking, October 2014, I had spent ~28 hours on social media! I was appalled by this realization. If this trend had continued, I would be wasting more than a day of my life each month on social networks. I was motivated to change.

<sup>*October 2014, so glad things have changed since then*</sup>

Fast forward to today<sup>1</sup>, where I now average 21 minutes a day on social media (~11 hours per month). A 61% improvement over the past year! The key takeaway here is that although I did not have a target metric, the act of tracking itself persuaded me to change my habits.

This tactic has spilled over into may other areas of my life:

- Mood

    Due to personal circumstances, these past three months have arguably been the toughest in my life so far. To cope with this, I decided to actively track<sup>2</sup> my mood using [Moodnotes](http://moodnotes.thriveport.com). This has allowed me to better be at ease with my emotions and prevent thoughts from snowballing internally.

- Food (MyFitnessPal and Lark)

- Money (Mint, quitting coffee)

- Age (Impulse and Screen Saver) examples

- Making sense of all the data (Gyroscope)
- When moving towards a specific metric, improve by 1% each day (include James Clear link)
- Wrap up

<sup>1</sup>: To accomplish this, I made heavy use of RescueTime's push notifications (and enabled persistent alerts, see image below) and used [SelfControl](http://selfcontrolapp.com).
