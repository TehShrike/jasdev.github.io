Growing up, I generally participated in outdoor activities like sports and skateboarding. However, a big part of my childhood was spent indoors in online communities that seemingly had an always-on conversation. Whether it was designing forum signatures for fellow members in the [Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)) Forums or learning how to install [modchips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modchip) from Xbox modding threads, I was always fascinated by these online worlds. Whenever I felt lonely, I tried to turn things around by jumping into these conversations to learn and grow with my Internet friends.

Fast-forward to my time in college. I unfortunately lost touch with my online friends because life started moving faster. However, in February 2013, something amazing started. Eight close friends and I created a Facebook [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com) thread called 'Awesomest Turntable DJs'<sup>1</sup> (a reference to us previously listening to music on [Turntable.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntable.fm)). Roughly three years later, we have sent over 166k messages (an average of 173 per day). While some may consider this volume distracting, the thread has honestly helped me through the toughest times of my life so far.

Despite moving to five different states<sup>2</sup> after graduation, this thread has kept us close. We have supported each other through breakups, family losses, near-tragic bike accidents, and those troubles that blindside you at [4pm on some idle Tuesday](http://www.davidpbrown.co.uk/poetry/mary-schmich.html). We are also a cheering squad for one another. There is no better feeling than sharing a win with your closest friends and being met with a flood of [Minions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions_(film)), [Inside Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)), and corgi stickers. Below are a handful of moments I wanted to highlight from our thread:

Balance is key here. When the messages get too noisy, I take a step back and mute the thread for a few hours. This allows me to find my own headspace. If you feel the need to read every message as it arrives, you will never actually enjoy the conversation. That's the beauty of asynchronous communication!

Related to always-on conversations is ambient noise. While silence is important, I have found that ambient noise (in various forms) can help fill in life's duller moments. For example, when I [worked remotely](/remote-work-and-loneliness/), I used an ambient noise generator, [Noizio](http://noiz.io), to immerse myself in a coffee shop sounds. Additionally, since [moving to New York City](http://jasdev.me/one-month-at-recurse-center/), I have used podcasts as a way to make commuting much more engaging.

In summary, always-on conversations have helped make life that much better ❤️ While today's generation is often portrayed with our heads down buried in our phones, it is helpful to reframe the picture. That person on the subway glued to their phone might be going through a rough time and is using this connectivity to stay close to those who are not physically present.
