title: The Interplay Between High-Cadence and Well-Formed Thoughts
permalink: high-cadence-versus-well-formed
---

Back in January, I started a public, high-cadence log of [what’s on my mind](/thoughts)<sup>1</sup>. Along the spectrum between my [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/jasdev) and this blog, the journal sits in-between. _Unpolished_ thoughts, developed over time. Six months and 46 entries later, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my experience so far.

## Why?

Two reasons. First, to create a distillery for my thoughts. By regularly thinking in public, I can better spot themes, [reconsolidate memories](/memory-reconsolidation), and orbit around future posts. Secondly, it felt like the most natural solution to the following question: “What single document should you read before meeting me to know what’s on my mind?” Or as [Ryan](http://twitter.com/ryandawidjan) succinctly put it, a “one-way coffee with my brain.“

## What Went Well?

One of the subtle—yet subconscious—lenses I _accidentally_ use when thinking about my favorite creators (writers, artists, engineers, etc.) is through their volumes of work<sup>2</sup>. “She is the creator of A and B and wrote a wonderful post on C.” It’s [too easy to forget](/value-of-conferences#humanizing-heroes) that __we’re not our work__.

This journal helped reveal my inner gears. More specifically, it allowed others to see beyond the blog posts, [side projects](https://twitter.com/parrots/status/779014268905816064), and [(bad) puns](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/791701214664790016).

## What Didn't Go So Well?

- Almost an escape valve for ambition, when it comes to shipping longer posts
    - That last 20% is where I get the most growth (akin to sticking points in a rep)
- Didn’t build any tooling around linking to specific days / thoughts
    - Link to JF’s post on avoiding the “configuration trap” when it comes to writing
- Friction in updating the entry
    - Mention Ryan’s approach being better here

## Moving Forward

- Thoughts collection
- RSS Feed for thoughts
    - While I initially thought the lack of notifications would be an asset, it ended up adding friction for people who would otherwise love reading the journal (@wahoo’s tweet about now knowing the thought journal)
- Like Justin Duke’s keyboard shortcut for blog posts, I’m going to make one for the thought journal
- Add it to my Daily Review process
    - OmniFocus
    - Mint
    - Thought and Private Journal

<sup>1</sup>: This experiment was inspired by Ryan’s attempt at this: [High-Cadence Thoughts](http://quip.com/jgBUALiGBjwp)

<sup>2</sup>: On the note of “volumes of work,” an example that still blows me away is [Above & Beyond](https://twitter.com/aboveandbeyond)’s radio show: [Group Therapy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/above-beyond-group-therapy/id286889904?mt=2) (formerly [Trance Around the World](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/above-beyond-trance-around-the-world/id993499023?mt=2)). The group has run the podcast every week for 688 weeks (13+ years) so far!
