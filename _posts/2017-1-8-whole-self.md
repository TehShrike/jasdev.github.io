Lately, I’ve had little desire to tackle side projects. This realization hit me hard. Especially as someone who participated in [countless hackathons](https://www.instagram.com/p/PnOAuvNa-Q), [helped start one at their school](http://www.nbc29.com/story/25232742/uva-students-participate-in-36-hour-hack-a-thon), and whose [side project landed him and his friends a trip to visit Snapchat’s HQ](https://medium.com/@binroot/the-best-jokes-have-no-punchline-5f4713a963d6#.dbny4gut0) back in July of 2013. Our industry, _tends_ to espouse the idea that you must always have a side project—often citing them as a factor in hiring decisions. Sitting with this question of why I no longer cared for side projects (at the moment), I reflected on my [decision to join Peloton](http://spoonbill.io/datum/81425/), how our industry’s perspective on side projects is egalitarian, and a potential relation to management.

Since joining [Peloton](http://pelotoncycle.com), I’ve almost had to throttle my drive for the product. I’m finally in a domain where I could see myself in for the next 50+ years. As my friend [Dustin](https://twitter.com/dustin) put it, this is [such a good place to be](https://twitter.com/dustin/status/768182651698110464). I’m pouring my __whole self__ into work, leaving little energy for side projects. Looking back at previous jobs, during which I juggled multiple side projects, this logic seems to hold. I cared deeply about my time at [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)—and couldn’t be more thankful for how the people there molded me—but the vectors of the companies’ missions and my [personal one](https://github.com/Jasdev/thoughts/blame/33113769819be196617b611387f51d8fc8b96af2/core-values.md#L6) weren’t completely aligned<sup>1</sup>. Side projects made up for this. Generalizing, this could be a useful test for determining if you’ve strayed from your [personal trajectory](/lessons-after-college#trajectories). This test—like any—can lead to false positives. Some constantly build side projects [for the thrill of it](https://twitter.com/deray/status/817219653386768384). [Chad Etzel](https://twitter.com/jazzychad) is [prime example of this](https://twitter.com/jazzychad/timelines/773442085278085121).

[Tess Rinearson](https://twitter.com/_tessr) captured the problem with using side projects as a hiring filter really well.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Actually, I &quot;get&quot; it with students, since school doesn&#39;t necessarily teach you how to build. But otherwise it seems like a false filter.</p>&mdash; Tess Rinearson (@_tessr) <a href="https://twitter.com/_tessr/status/596142191002583040">May 7, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Having the time and energy to work on side projects is a form of privilege. “The people most likely to have spare time to do outside projects are people who don’t have families to take care of (kids, parents, whatever), who have a good, steady income (i.e. not learning while, say, balancing two part-time jobs), or who live close to work (minimizing a commute)<sup>2</sup>.” On the other hand, “some folks are permitted [and encouraged] to work on [side projects], as a part of their full-time work, so [we] shouldn’t [_completely_] ignore [them]<sup>3</sup>.”

### How This Could Apply to Management

There might be an important management lesson buried in the concept of putting your “whole self” into work<sup>4</sup>. When I’m a manager (someday, fingers crossed), I’d like to structure sprints with the most important __and__ _most interesting_ work. The latter shouldn’t be relegated to [20% time](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-20-percent-time-policy-2015-4). It should be a first-class citizen, as it affects the team’s momentum (and excitement) in tangible ways. Moreover, [this is especially important for one-person shops](https://blog.curtisherbert.com/slopes-diaries-16-recovering-from-a-stall/). A gauge to see if your engineers are disengaged from their workload might be the presence of side projects (if they’re open to sharing and noting that this doesn’t paint a complete picture). If business needs make it impossible to harmonize the most important and the most interesting, I’d add items to be excited about in future sprints. Doing so generally builds anticipation, making the current sprint more tolerable.

I’ll likely start a few side projects again at some point. But, for now, the fact that I’m pouring all of my engineering love into work allows me to redirect personal love to my [friends](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/800469476600909824), [family](https://www.instagram.com/p/BOIcBPeAis3), and writing posts like this ❤️
