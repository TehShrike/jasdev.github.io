title: A Couple of Thoughts on Groups

In the moments after a small win, a handful of people come to mind for me in sharing it. My [Mom](https://www.instagram.com/p/ST0WB3Na4y), the ‚Äú[Awesomest Turntable DJs](/always-on-conversations),‚Äù [Ryan, Kunal](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/869938469153492999), [Shiva](/monthly-checkins), and my roommates to name a few. Thinking about this list of people, I wonder if it‚Äôs possible to _gracefully_ scale this intimacy from a handful to a dozen<sup>1</sup>. We tend to view scale and intimacy as an undisputed dichotomy. While I believe this is true on extreme ends of the spectrum (i.e. it‚Äôs difficult to have meaningful dialogues with hundreds of people), I want to explore how services like Snapchat foster this in a more balanced way.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One thing I&#39;ve learned to value in recent years is ‚Äúintimacy over scale‚Äù</p>&mdash; jason kinda (@jasonbrennan) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbrennan/status/806177051661271040">December 6, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Aside from the technical hurdles involved, I‚Äôd bet that Snap‚Äôs delay in releasing groups was somewhat intentional. Snapchat fosters closeness in both regular snaps (one user to‚Äîpotentially‚Äîmany, in a _directed_ fashion) or Stories (one user to many, _undirected_).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ability to share to many *individuals* as opposed to a group is one of Snapchats most underrated innovations <a href="https://t.co/TyoY7AAHTH">pic.twitter.com/TyoY7AAHTH</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Greenglass (@jgreenglass) <a href="https://twitter.com/jgreenglass/status/799416249109254144">November 18, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The beauty of this dynamic is that it allows individual recipients to maintain separate threads with the sender, as opposed to placing them all in a single, larger bucket<sup>2</sup>. This ‚Äòbucketing‚Äô is essentially what groups do. While groups reduce friction when firing off messages to specific friends, it‚Äôs nice to know someone [chose to individually share a moment with you](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/757397911592394752)<sup>3</sup>. The latter almost feels like the digital equivalent of receiving a handwritten letter, especially when compared to the minimal effort required to toss a message into a bucket‚Äîwhether named (group) or unnamed (Stories).

Another aspect of group dynamics that I‚Äôve been mulling over is dissolution<sup>4</sup>. This stemmed from my interviews with [Chorus](https://twitter.com/chorus) back in the fall of 2016. While Chorus focuses on small groups to help users achieve their health and fitness goals, I had asked the team if they had any ideas on how to _gently_ disband groups (especially those centered on temporal goals, like training for a marathon). The interviewers and I felt that forced ‚Äòclosings‚Äô weren‚Äôt the right answer and leaned towards dismissal by inactivity (i.e. users gradually leaving when groups idle, much like Slack channels today). On a personal level, I‚Äôve noticed group threads will often spawn smaller subgroups (along characteristic or situational divisions). For example, [TNN](/always-on-conversations) has a separate thread for the handful of us who are single to recap our‚Äîoften hilarious‚Äîexperiences dating, without disturbing the larger group. Moreover, a few friends and I use a [Discord](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/862696294770499584)<sup>5</sup> thread (that forked from a larger server) to discuss dance music. On a larger scale, [Peloton](https://www.pelotoncycle.com)‚Äôs [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pelotonriders) also split into [similar subgroups](https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=peloton). This make me wonder if there is sort-of ‚Äú[Dunbar‚Äôs Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)‚Äù for groups, marking the point at which the size (and frequency of contact) of the group lends itself to subgroups forming.

## Footnotes
<sup>1</sup>: Similar to [Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(social_network)) limiting user‚Äôs friends lists in adherence to [Dunbar‚Äôs number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number)

<sup>2</sup>: Much like a form of ‚Äúsocial [bcc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_carbon_copy)‚Äù when you think about it.

<sup>3</sup>: Even though Twitter isn‚Äôt typically associated with groups, I‚Äôve experimented with one-to-many, public, _directed_ sharing in the form of an ongoing Corgi picture thread (I have the goofiest grin on my face as I type out this footnote):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/giladronat">@giladronat</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/paulrehkugler">@paulrehkugler</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alicexyr">@alicexyr</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mallyvai">@mallyvai</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/coultonvento">@coultonvento</a> two servings of Tofu today üòç <a href="https://t.co/8U8ai9HAEK">https://t.co/8U8ai9HAEK</a></p>&mdash; Jasdev Singh (@jasdev) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/799426899323670528">November 18, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This approach sits between sharing with private groups or your entire following graph (i.e. one-to-many, public, _undirected_). Moreover, it has the added benefit of allowing the @-mentioned users to change over time.

<sup>4</sup>: I briefly noted about group _formation_ at the end of my [Featured Follow post](https://medium.com/featuredfollow/featured-follow-jasdev-singh-2c5042abe3f6).

<sup>5</sup>: Discord also facilitates channel trimming in an automated fashion with [AFK Channels and Timeouts](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/213530048-Advanced-Community-Server-Setup).
