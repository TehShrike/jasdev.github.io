title: Tracking as a Catalyst for Change

When building a new habit, momentum is often the hardest part for me. Starting small helps, but I often need a larger impetus. To tackle this, I began tracking relevant factors to each habit. For example, last year, I made a goal of spending less time on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook). I did not take this habit seriously until I installed [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com) and realized how much time I was wasting. RescueTime is a small app that runs on your computer (and Android phone), tracking how much time you spend on specific applications and websites. In my first full month of tracking, October 2014, I had spent ~28 hours on social media! I was appalled by this realization. If this trend had continued, I would be wasting more than a day of my life each month on social networks. I was motivated to change.

<sup>*October 2014, so glad things have changed since then*</sup>

Fast forward to today<sup>1</sup>, where I now average 11 hours on on social media per month (21 minutes a day). A 61% improvement over the past year! The key takeaway here is that although I did not have a target metric, the act of tracking itself persuaded me to change my habits.

This tactic has spilled into many other areas of my life:

- Mood

    Over the summer, I was getting over a breakup and it was very challenging. To cope, I decided to actively track<sup>2</sup> my mood using [Moodnotes](http://moodnotes.thriveport.com). This has allowed me to better be at ease with my emotions and prevent thoughts from snowballing internally.

- Food

    I have generally been consistent with exercise. However, my diet has always been an unclear strategy of just picking "healthy" foods, without actually tracking macronutrients. To make this approach more concrete, I began tracking my meals with [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com). Once I got into the swing of things, I transitioned to using [Lark](http://www.web.lark.com). Lark is more personal, as it uses a virtual coach to cheer you on in making healthier choices.

- Money

    [Mint](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mint-quickview/id533491939?mt=12) will always be in my menu bar. Having all of my financial accounts in a single dashboard has been invaluable. For example, I quit coffee after realizing how much money I was wasting (~$100 a month), in addition to the benefits of a caffeine-free diet.

- Age

    I never truly appreciated how fast time moves until I installed Sam Soffes' [age ticker screensaver](https://github.com/soffes/motivation). Seeing my age increment each time I approach my computer reminds me of life's finiteness<sup>3</sup>. Additionally, I ported this concept to an [iOS app and Today Extension](https://github.com/jasdev/impulse)<sup>4</sup>!

## Where do we go from here?

While tracking these domains is the first step, I believe the future of human improvement lies in aggregating them in a meaningful way. This is where we can make even deeper conclusions about our lives. Currently, my bet is with [Anand Sharma](https://twitter.com/aprilzero) and the [Gyroscope](http://gyrosco.pe/) team to solve this. Their site (and upcoming app) integrates with various services to present your life in a beautiful dashboard.

It is fascinating what you can do with all of this data in a [single place](https://gyrosco.pe/jasdev/). You can see [every place](https://gyrosco.pe/jasdev/explorer/) I have been to since 2012<sup>5</sup> or check my most recent [heart rate measurement](https://gyrosco.pe/jasdev/sport/).

## Final Thoughts

While habit change often involves moving towards specific goals<sup>6</sup>, tracking is often eye-opening enough to incite positive change. Insight on metrics I want to improve has enabled me to better coordinate my efforts. After all, you can't reach your north star goals without establishing a frame of reference.
