In an effort to [read more books](https://www.coach.me/plans/904-read) each year, I've decided to make my reading list public. Below you'll find a list of books I've read (started logging in 2015) and am currently reading!

Have any recommendations? Feel free to let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jasdev)!
