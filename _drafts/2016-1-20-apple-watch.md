title: The Apple Watch Is About the Small Things

I've had an Apple Watch for 8 months and 9 days. I often get asked about its "killer features" and if "it's worth the money." The watch may not have _one_ epic feature that justifies the price. However, it has improved my life in many small ways, making it invaluable to me.

## Complications

Complications are my favorite feature of the watch. They're widgets that you can add to specific watch faces. Here are  three I use every day:

- [CityMapper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/citymapper-real-time-transit/id469463298?mt=8)

Since moving to New York City, I use CityMapper to navigate through the subway system. Their complication shows your current ETA on a given trip. Moreover, the iOS app can forward notifications with train arrival times and reminders for when to get off!

- [Dark Sky](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dark-sky-hyperlocal-weather/id517329357?mt=8)

You haven't experienced a weather app until you've used Dark Sky. Seriously. Dark Sky gives you _local_ notifications about upcoming weather events. Going to rain in an hour? Dark Sky will give you a heads up in advance. [Time Travel](http://www.apple.com/watchos-2/) also allows you to quickly check the weather a few hours ahead by using the Digital Crown on your watch face.

- [Fantastical](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-calendar-reminders/id718043190?mt=8)
 
Since the developers at [Sunrise](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar-outlook-app/id599114150?mt=8) have stopped work on the app post-Microsoft acquisition, I switched to Fantastical. Their complication and watchOS app goes beyond the default Calendar app baked into iOS.
